    Iain Murray's conversion of mnist to binary format. The
    provenance is from Hugo Larochelle's website.

        Analysis of Deep Belief Networks*, Proceedings of the 25th

        binarized_mnist/binarized_mnist_{train,valid,test}.amat

    Note that this dataset is not quite what you might expect:

        * randomized dithering limits compression roughly 50%
        * no labels
        * validation could have "writer" information leakage

    But at this point this dataset is in standard use so I'm
    making it available for comparison to published results.

    Since I don't have labels, I'm just running it through the
    autoencoder with reconstruction; Seems to converge, but haven't
    verified it's doing the right thing.
    
    This version gets stuck at 0.2358 on the first epoch and remains
    until epoch 12. 1 second per epoch on a GeForce GTX 680 GPU.
    (This is probably a bug that needs to be fixed).
